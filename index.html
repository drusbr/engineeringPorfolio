            <div class="section-content">
                <p>My name is Davi Abreu Ruschel, and I am currently a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Bath. From a young age, I have been fascinated by the intricacies of mechanical systems and the principles that govern their operation. This fascination has only deepened over the years, particularly during my final years of school when I decided to pursue a career in engineering.</p>

                <h4>Personal Project</h4>
                <p>In this project I developed a computer simulation on MATLAB for a Formula 1 car from first principles. Taking into account tire degradation, fuel consumption, aerodynamics and mechanical systems of the car, I was able to simulate lap times with 0.5 seconds accuracy.</p>
